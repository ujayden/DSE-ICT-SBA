School-based Assessment (SBA) of ICT elective C - Multimedia Production and Web Site Development

School-based Assessment (SBA) is an assessment carried out by schools with students being assessed by their own subject teachers. By integrating learning and teaching with assessment, it helps students understand their strengths and weaknesses through quality feedback from teachers. All school candidates have to complete the SBA of the subjects concerned and the marks awarded are counted towards their results in the HKDSE. SBA also reduces dependence on the results of public examinations and boosts studentsâ€™ confidence and motivation to learn and enhances autonomous learning.
