Welcome, viewers.
Have you ever wonder how your home

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.625
network works?
How does your phone magically

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:15.083
connect to the Internet with out a
physical cable?

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:19.083
Today I'm going to show the inner
thing of your home network and show

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:23.250
you how it all come together with
my assistant, Jack.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.208
Jack.
Say hello to them.

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:29.791
Hi, I am Jack.
Let's start now.

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:33.375
All right, let's introduce
this.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.791
This is a wireless router.

00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:38.833
It acts as the central hub of your
home network, connecting your

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.875
devices to the Internet.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.083
It just like a traffic controller
for data flowing in and out of your

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:45.833
home, is it?

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:50.041
You are right, Jack.
But what about this?

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.375
This is emm... emm... what?

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:57.708
Jack, they are called Rj-45 ports that allow you to

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:01.750
connect device using wired
connection. But we will come

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.708
back to them later.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:07.583
But first, let's understand
how the router connect to the

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:09.041
Internet.

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:10.291
Okay.

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:13.500
To connect to the Internet we need
a modem.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.791
This device converts the signal
from the Internet service provider

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.916
into a form that allow router
understand it.

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:24.125
Just like the translator between
your home network and the race

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.333
Internet, there are different
types of smooth them such as cable

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:33.041
modem and DSL modems.
In this case we have an optical

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:38.166
modem which is provided many fast
speed with the fiber optical cable.

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.333
It's really fast.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.583
Hey.

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.791
What is this box with...?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.875
...RJ-45 Port Jayden.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:52.125
They are switch when you have
multiple devices in your home

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:56.291
network and need more port.
A switch are here to help you.

00:01:56.291 --> 00:02:00.625
It explained the number of
available ports and allowing you to

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:04.125
connect more devices to your
network.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.916
Now let's set up our whole own home
network.

00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:11.958
It is easier than you might think.
I know, I know.

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.375
First, connect the router to
the computer using an Ethernet

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:16.916
cable.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.333
Great.

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:27.041
Once connects, we will go through
a quick setup process.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.750
And it is time to go.
Next step, Jack, you do it

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.458
lets me do it.

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:44.458
On the smartphone, go to the
Wi-Fi settings and select your

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:45.833
network.

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:54.541
Yes.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.500
My phone is now connected to the
Internet wirelessly.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.500
I can browse the web, stream
videos and stay connected wherever

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.750
you go within your home.

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:08.791
Look at all these devices connected
to our home network.

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:12.750
From laptops to smart TVs,
gaming consoles to smart home

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.541
devices, they're all now connected
together.

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.916
It's really powerful.

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:25.416
Can't wait to see everything connected
to my home network to build a smart

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:26.750
home.

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:30.083
And that's how your home network
works.

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:33.250
You have been learned all about how
to build a net home network

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.458
yourself.

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.500
